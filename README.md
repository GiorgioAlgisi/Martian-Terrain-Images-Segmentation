# Martian-terrain-Images-Segmentation
Project related to the course of "Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning" (AN2DL) at POLIMI (polytechnic university of Milan)

## Introduction
This project was developed to solve an image classification problem as part of [Second challenge of the course of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (AN2DL)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/airlab-polimi_artificialneuralnetworks-deeplearning-semanticsegmentation-activity-7274099168485277696-GhP9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

## Goal
The challenge was to tackle a complex image segmentation problem: In particular, we had to make use of UNetâ€™s architectures and state-of-the-art techniques to build a model capable of correctly identifying and classifying different types of terrain at pixel level in the images taken by the Curiosity rover during the exploration of Mars.

## Results
The model achieved a Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 70% over the private test set.

## Final Grade
5.5/5.5 points
